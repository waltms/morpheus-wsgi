			Credits: <br>We are excited to include the time-honored <a href="https://github.com/PerseusDL/morpheus">Morpheus</a> parser here as a fall-back or second opinion for our own static database, which is far from offering parses for all words in Greek literature. Morpheus was originally written by Gregory Crane for the Perseus project. This version comes from <a href="https://github.com/perseids-tools/">The Perseids Project Tools</a> on GitHub. <a href="https://github.com/waltms/morpheus-wsgi" target="_blank">Web interface</a> by Walter M. Shandruk. Note: please report incorrect parses and other malfunctions to us. Do bear with us as we try to understand this tool better!  <br>
